Description: Allometry models and plant productivity data for LUMCON salt marshes.
    Builds on data and analysis presented in Hill and Roberts 2017 (Ecology and Evolution; <DOI: 10.1002/ece3.3494>). Data included represent stem- and plot-level plant dynamics, soil physical and chemical characteristics, and water quality parameters.
